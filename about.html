    <h1>About This Website</h1>
    <p>This website was created with a very simple goal: to help undergraduate students of Kashmir University access notes semester-wise — quickly, easily, and for free. As a student myself, I (CD) was constantly frustrated by the lack of centralized, well-organized resources for study materials. Every time exams came closer, I had to scramble through WhatsApp groups or ask seniors for PDFs — and many times, I couldn’t find what I needed.</p>
    <p>So I decided to solve this problem by building this site. I collected the notes I had and started putting them semester-wise, subject-wise, to help other students like me. Whether you're in your 1st semester or final year, you’ll find all major subjects available for free download — without any ads or signup.</p>
    <p>My goal is not just to share PDFs but to save your time and reduce your stress. Education should be accessible, and this is my small way of making it easier for Kashmir University students to succeed.</p>
